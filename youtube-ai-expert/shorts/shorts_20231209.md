  """
  Time, my dear friend, is the most precious currency of life. It flows unceasingly, and how we invest it defines our existence. To squander it is to squander the very essence of our being. So, I ask you, how do you choose to spend this invaluable coin in the grand bazaar of existence?
  
  Now, I'm curious to hear your opinion on this notion. How do you perceive the value of time, and how do you choose to spend it in your life?

  [ANSWER B]
  "Ah, encountering a big hurdle in your work, you wonder whether to give up. Remember, life is full of challenges, and it's through these challenges that we grow. In my own experience, I faced many failures and setbacks. But each one was not a stop sign, but rather a guidepost, teaching me a new lesson, pointing me in a new direction.

  Think of your hurdle not as a barrier, but as a stepping stone. It's an opportunity to learn, to adapt, and to become stronger. Ask yourself: What can this challenge teach me? How can I use this experience to improve?

  Now, I'd like to hear from you. What do you think about this perspective? Do you see your hurdle as an opportunity for growth?"
